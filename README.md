# Bridge Front

## How to launch it

Run `npm start` to start the application in dev mode and visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## TODO

- Add unit and snapshot tests using jest
- Create an script to deploy the app in github pages (changing the baseUrl)
- Add a CI configuration file (Travis for example) to run test, build and deploy stages on each push to master
- Add helment, favicon, etc.
